        <h2>This page was originally called "Extra" but I'm too lazy to change it</h2>
        <p>Alexander was too powerful for reality and his superhuman feats transcended the laws of nature. Modern-day
            doubters insist that he "wasn't born from Zeus" and was "shorter" than the Achaemenid King Darius III, but
            those chumps probably don't even know the difference between Macedonia and Greece.</p>
